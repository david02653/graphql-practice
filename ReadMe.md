## GraphQL practice
this practice is based on [GraphQL official example](https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot/) and this [Article](https://medium.com/oril/spring-boot-graphql-mongodb-8733002b728a)

### note that pure GraphQL official spring boot example needs to run on [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground)
if you want to run on Postman, you need to change GraphQL schema setting
